Assignment: Call Quality Analyzer
##***
I used OpenAI Whisper for transcription since it handles noisy audio well and runs on Colabâ€™s free GPU. The audio is downloaded and converted into text. Speaker diarization is simulated using silence-based segmentation, alternating between sales rep and customer. From the transcript, I computed:

Talk-time ratio by word distribution.

Number of questions by detecting ? in text.

Longest monologue using silence splits.

Sentiment analysis with HuggingFace transformers.

Actionable insight rule-based on balance of talk-time and questions.

The system works under 30s on Colab (small Whisper model). Bonus attempt: sales rep vs customer is approximated by alternating speaker turns.
